    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      <br>Currently I am attending college at Kent State studying computer science
      with data engineering and cybersecurity concentration. I also attend as many of the Kent State's student computer science club's meetings as my schedule allows.
       I am sceduled to graduate in December 2026, in my last few semester I have had the wonderful opportunuity to work with friends on projects and make new connections. In addition to being a full time student I do currently work part time, for more information check out my 
       <a href="resume.html">employment history!</a>
      <br><br>
      I went to Lake High school and graduated in 2023. 
      While there I participated in the marching band, the women's soccer team, and the Lake STEM club. 
      Where I went to high shool is very important to me as it shaped who I am today. Through the people I met and the classes I took while I was there, is the reason I began to love coding and stregthened my love for mathematics.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy a few creative hobbies that help me relax and express myself.
      I love reading, doing my nails, and have recently started learning crochet.
      I often find inspiration and new ideas from artists and creators online.
