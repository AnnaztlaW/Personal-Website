    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      <br>Currently I am attending college at Kent State studying computer science
      with data engineering concentration. I also attend as many of the Kent State's student computer science club's meetings as my schedule allows.
       In addition to being a full time student I do currently work part time, for more information check out my 
       <a href="resume.html">employment history!</a>
      <br><br>
      I went to Lake High school and graduated in 2023. 
      While there I participated in the marching band which I loved because the people who ran it were amazing and so kind. 
      I was in the percussion section through marching and concert band, but played snare specfically during the marching season.
      <br>I was also a member of the women's soccer team and the STEM club. Additional highschool was were I began to love computers, technology, and math.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have two main hobbies with is reading and doing my nails. 
      I find both relaxing and meditative, and doing my nails is a great creative outlet where I can express myself.
      I get most of my inspiration from Instagram and <a href = "https://www.pinterest.com/annawaltz/nails/"> Pinterest</a>.
      <br>
      I also love reading and I primarily read online as it is generally less waste and a bit more inexpensive than physical copies. 
      Most of my reads are fanasty and adventure.
